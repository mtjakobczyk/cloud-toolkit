- These On-Demand Instances must match certain attributes, such as instance type and Region, in order to benefit from the billing discount.
- The offering class of a Reserved Instance is either Standard or Convertible. A Standard Reserved Instance provides a more significant discount than a Convertible Reserved Instance, but you can't exchange a Standard Reserved Instance.
